# Scaler-Assignment
This Node.js pipeline scrapes Jira issues from Apache projects (HADOOP, SPARK, KAFKA) and converts them into structured JSONL data for LLM training. It supports pagination, rate limiting, retries, checkpoints, and batching for reliability. Data is cleaned, transformed, and streamed efficiently for summarization, classification, and Q&amp;A tasks.
